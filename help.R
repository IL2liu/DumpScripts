#' phenotypicForest produces two types of plots:
#' 1) phorests: similar to epidemiological forest plots but used for comparing the effects of SNPs on phenotypes. Phenotypes can be grouped by themes. Phorests can also be used to compare groups of SNPs.
#' 2) polarHistogram: plots a large number of histogram on a wheel, to save space.
